- default layout (don't need for one page, but show off knowledge)
- metadata
- header and footer components (in default layout)
- don't really need any other layouts for this
- maybe include demo page(s) to send links to
- review using assets

## Components Needed (I think)
- Nav
- button
  - can we give class for colour?
  - have colors ops defined using props?
  - yes: https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.html
  - declare btn-color as prop for button component
  - interpolate color as class in button.vue
  - style 3 different colors in button.vue
- carousel
- footer
- hero
- text & picture
  - change side using prop

### For Every Component (Actually maybe every unique page, which is just one)
- meta information
  - can be in script but example project has in html

### Other
- maybe 2 columns is component
